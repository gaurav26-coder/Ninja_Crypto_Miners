# Ninja_Crypto_Miners
**Hey welcome to Ninja Crypto Miners, We are team of 3 members with aim to fullfill the needs and awareness about Crypto Currencies.**
## Inspiration
Cryptocurrency is the modern day digital currency in which a lot of people are investing. It is fast, reliable and allows transfer of currency easily around the world. Its advantages and growth motivated us to build this website. 

## What it does
This is a real time bitcoin tracker which tracks and represents the data in the form of graph. The user can also create an account and view their data. 

## How we built it
We built the website using HTML5, CSS and JavaScript. The tracker is built using an API. The IDE used is Visual Studio Code. 

## Challenges we ran into
Due to lack of domain and skill knowledge we have restricted  ourselves to a simple version of the website. 

## Accomplishments that we’re proud of
We’re proud of successfully creating this website which allows users to track bitcoin in real time and keep a record of it. 

## What we learned
We learned about cryptocurrencies and how useful it is. The website building was interesting and fun and we learnt to work with APIs and use it in our project.
